Project Description
Living in Berlin, I have the feeling that the interest in the feminist porn movement is growing steadily for the past few years.

In this project I would like to see if that is true and if the interest is also growing in other countries.

To do that I am planning on creating a news article database and check the number of articles talking about feminist porn over time depending on the countries.

Hypothesis
Feminist porn is a movement that is more present in germany than in other countries.

That movement is also perceived better in Germany than in other parts of the world.

I scraped Google News for articles on feminist porn in 3 languages: english, german and french in order to build my dataset

Analysis
I did a sentiment analysis in the 3 different languages as well as over time.

Conclusion
A bit more articles on feminist porn in german does not prove a real difference in interest in german speaking countries.

There seems to be clearly a more positive view on feminist porn in german articles than in the other language. French being the least positive.

I would need to get more and more reliable data in order to be able to look more into details. (4304 articles)
